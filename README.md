# NFL Machine Learning Sports Prediction
I wanted to see if I could beat regular predictions of NFL games and use machine learning algorithms to find them. Here's a step-by-step guide on how I created machine learning software for betting. 

## Step-By-Step Breakdown:

<li>
Define Your Objective:

Clearly define the purpose of your betting software. What kind of bets do you want to make? (e.g., sports betting, stock market predictions, etc.)</li>

<li>Gather Data:

Collect historical data related to the events you want to bet on. For sports betting, this could include past game results, player statistics, weather conditions, and more. For stock market predictions, you'd need historical stock price data, financial indicators, news sentiment, etc. </li>

<li>Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.</li>

<li>Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features from your data. This step can significantly impact the performance of your machine learning model. For example, in sports betting, you might create features like team win streaks, player injury status, etc. </li>

<li>Select a Machine Learning Algorithm:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your task. Common choices include regression for predicting numerical outcomes (e.g., stock prices) and classification for predicting discrete outcomes (e.g., win or lose in sports). </li>

<li>Split Data for Training and Testing:

Split your dataset into training and testing sets. This helps you evaluate your model's performance on unseen data. </li>

<li>Model Training:

Train your machine learning model using the training data. Fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the model for better performance.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error for regression, Accuracy for classification). </li>
<li>Risk Management:

Implement risk management strategies. Betting inherently involves risk, so consider how much to bet on each prediction and set limits to prevent significant losses. </li>
<li>Deployment:

Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, deploy it as a software application. Users can input current data, and the model will make predictions. </li>
<li>Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor your model's performance and update it as needed. Machine learning models may degrade over time if not maintained. </li>
<li>Legal and Ethical Considerations:

Ensure that your betting software complies with legal regulations in your area. Be responsible and ethical in its use. </li>
<li>Feedback Loop:

Gather feedback from users and use it to improve your software continually.</li>
