# NFL Machine Learning Sports Prediction

I wanted to see if I could beat regular predictions of NFL games and use machine learning algorithms to find them. Here's a step-by-step guide on how I created machine learning software for betting.

**Disclaimer: Please don't sue me if you lose all your money, this is just for fun :)**

## Step-By-Step Breakdown:

### Step 1: Define the problem and collect the data

The first step in creating a machine learning model for NFL game predictions is to define the problem that I want to solve and collect the data that I need to train and test my model. For instance, I may want to predict the outcomes of NFL games based on historical data, team statistics, and game results. In my case, I gathered this data from pro football reference, although it's worth noting that it wasn't readily available, and I had to build a web scraper to obtain it.

### Step 2: Explore and preprocess the data

Next, it's crucial to explore and preprocess the collected NFL game data to make it suitable for machine learning. This involves tasks such as:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize the data to understand its characteristics, distribution, patterns, outliers, and relationships. Various tools and techniques, such as descriptive statistics, histograms, and scatter plots, can be helpful.

- Data cleaning: Remove or fix any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, duplicates, typos, and outliers. I utilized methods like imputation, deletion, correction, and transformation.

- Data transformation: Modify the data to make it more compatible with machine learning. This may include tasks like scaling, normalization, standardization, encoding, feature engineering, and feature selection.

### Step 3: Choose and train a machine learning algorithm

In the third step, I need to select and train a suitable machine learning algorithm for NFL game predictions. There are various types of machine learning algorithms that can be applied, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. My choice should consider factors such as data type, problem complexity, algorithm performance, computational resources, and interpretability.

Training my machine learning algorithm involves providing it with the prepared data and adjusting its parameters or weights. I also need to fine-tune the algorithm by selecting optimal hyperparameters or settings that control its behavior. Techniques like grid search, random search, and cross-validation can be employed for this purpose.

### Step 4: Evaluate and test my machine learning model

The fourth step entails evaluating and testing my machine learning model to assess its performance on new or unseen NFL game data. Various metrics and criteria can be used to measure the quality and accuracy of my model's predictions or decisions. Common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To perform this evaluation, I should use my testing data or a separate dataset that was not part of the training process. Additionally, it's essential to compare my model's performance with baseline or benchmark models to determine if it outperforms them.

### Step 5: Deploy and monitor my machine learning model

The final step is deploying and monitoring my NFL game prediction machine learning model, making it accessible for use and feedback. This involves activities such as:

- Deployment: Putting my machine learning model into production or operation so that it can receive new data and make predictions. Deployment options may include cloud services, web applications, mobile applications, and more.

- Monitoring: Tracking and evaluating my model's performance and behavior over time, ensuring it meets my expectations and requirements. Monitoring tools, such as dashboards, reports, alerts, and logs, can assist in this process.

This step-by-step guide provides an overview of how I created a machine learning software for NFL game predictions. Remember that this endeavor is not just about winning bets but also about the fun and learning experience it offers.
