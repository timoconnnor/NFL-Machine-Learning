# NFL Machine Learning Sports Prediction
I wanted to see if I could beat regular predictions of NFL games and use machine learning algorithms to find them. Here's a step-by-step guide on how I created machine learning software for betting.

## Step-By-Step Breakdown:

<li>
Data Collection:

Gather historical NFL game data, including detailed statistics, team information, and game results. You can find datasets from sources like the NFL API, sports data providers, or web scraping.</li>

<li>Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, normalize or scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables. </li>

<li>Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features that can impact the scores. These might include team performance averages, historical performance, player statistics, and even external factors like weather conditions.</li>

<li>Target Variable Preparation:

Decide on the specific regression target variable. It could be the total points scored in a game, the points scored by a specific team, or the point spread (difference in scores between two teams).</li>

<li>Data Splitting:

Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This allows you to train your model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate its performance on unseen data. </li>

<li>Model Selection:

Choose a regression algorithm suitable for predicting NFL game scores. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or more advanced models like neural networks. </li>

<li>Model Training:

Train your chosen model on the training dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters and feature sets to find the best model configuration.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation:

Evaluate your regression model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics quantify the difference between predicted and actual scores. </li>
<li>Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to improve its predictive performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can help with this.</li>
<li>Test Your Model:

Assess your model's performance on the test dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen NFL games. </li>
<li>Implement Betting Strategy:

Develop a betting strategy based on your score predictions. Consider factors like the predicted score difference, confidence level, and risk management. </li>
<li>Backtesting:

Backtest your betting strategy on historical data to evaluate its potential profitability and risks.</li>
<li>Deployment and Monitoring:

If your model performs well in testing and backtesting, consider deploying it for real-time predictions during NFL games. Continuously monitor its performance and adjust your betting strategy as needed.</li>
